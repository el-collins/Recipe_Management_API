# Recipe Management API 🍲

Welcome to the Recipe Management API, where culinary art meets coding! This FastAPI backend service is your digital sous-chef, helping you manage a delicious database of recipes, ingredients, and nutritional facts.

## Features 🌟

- **CRUD-y Goodness**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations are the bread and butter of our API, allowing full control over your culinary collection.
- **Search & Filter**: Looking for gluten-free? Low-calorie? Our API lets you sift through recipes faster than sifting flour!
- **Nutritional Calculations**: Automatically tally up the calories, fat, and protein so you can focus on the flavor.
